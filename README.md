This is company employee information query system which includes a login interface and a query interface.  
We simulated brute-force cracking, email phishing, DoS attacks and provided corresponding defense measures including rate limiting, multi-factor authentication, email filtering, SYN proxy, etc.  
The operation of attacks and defenses mostly relies on common python libraries and the Ubuntu environment. The operation steps of each attack and the corresponding defense are displayed in the README file in each folder.
